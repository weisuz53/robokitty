Is a DIY cat feeder controlled over the web (though not over
the public Internet for now) for my lovely cat Rufus.

There are two different feeding methods: instant feeding with the click of a button, or scheduled feedings (using a command scheduler like cron).

The idea behind the project came about because over the past few years all of the feeders I've came across have had a level of complication that weren't very user-friendly to new coders, and I wanted to make something that is easy enough for everyone to use.

Let's get started!
